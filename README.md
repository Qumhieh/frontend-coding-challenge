# Frontend Coding Challenge

Welcome to our Frontend Coding Challenge.

## Challenge

We need a landing page for our last minute business in Greece in the summer.

Unfortunately we have very little time to implement this. Our product stakeholders and UX/UI colleagues are all already on vacation or otherwise scheduled. So there is neither a design nor mockups available, nor have images been created or optimized.

So it's up to you to be creative and design and implement a landing page.

We were able to elicit some information from the product colleagues before they went on vacation.

And these are the following:

- Must be responsive from desktop to smartphone (smallest view 320px)
- Accessible as far as possible
- Should not show up in the index of search engines
- Minimum 6 offer teasers with a picture, hotel name, location (country, region, city) and a price
- Large Hero image at the top of the page with overlay text
- List of benefits of Greece
- Map view with random markers from the region
- Small contact form consisting of name, email (mandatory field) and a small note (mandatory field).
- A small current weather view of the current weather situation

Technical framework is as follows:

- For images please use Unsplash API <https://unsplash.com/developers> to generate images.
- For map view please use OpenstreetMap <https://www.openstreetmap.org/>
- For the weather view please use Weatherstack <https://weatherstack.com/>
- Contact form does not need to have a send function. But a validate must be available.

Further ideas or creative content is now completely up to you.

## Coding Requirements

We don't want you to use any frameworks for JavaScript or CSS.

You should program in vanilla JavaScript and create your own stylings.

## How to start

You please fork from our repository to your personal GitHub account. Your new repository should be set to public so that we can view it later.

We are not only interested in the final result, but also in the steps you have taken. Please try to develop a plan for yourself and then implement it in small steps, each of which you commit.

## How to use

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
